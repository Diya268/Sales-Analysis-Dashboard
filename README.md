# Sales-Analysis-Dashboard
I've created a data visualization dashboard for Madhav Ecommerce to analyze their online sales in India. 

# The highlights include:
- Created an interactive dashboard to track and analyze online sales data.
- Established connections, joined new tables, and performed calculations to manipulate data, and enabled user-driven parameters for visualizations.
- Utilized various customized visualizations such as bar charts, donut charts, and slicers.
